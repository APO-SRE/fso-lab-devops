# FSO Lab DevOps

Welcome to the Cisco Full Stack Observability (FSO) series of workshops! These workshops will introduce 
lab participants to Cisco’s Full Stack Observability solution and the foundational components of that 
solution: AppDynamics, ThousandEyes, and Intersight.

In this series of workshops and labs, lab participants will play a few different roles within an online 
global tea retailer. This retailer has been on the forefront of their niche industry. However, they have 
been running into some issues as of late during a major technical project. Throughout these workshops, 
participants will assume the identities of various technical leads as they implement aspects of the 
company’s full stack observability initiative.

## Learning Objectives

-	Understand Cisco’s vision around full stack observability and use cases addressed by each of the components.
-	Gain firsthand experience in developing aspects of the full stack ovservability solution for our retail company.
-	Learn how to translate concepts and ideas from the lab exercises to be utilized for your clients and customers.

## Workshop Overview

To facilitate these workshops, the FSO Lab DevOps project consists of a collection of build, deploy, and 
provisioning assets; sample application; lab guides; and instructions to aid in the delivery of the workshop.  

Customers, partners, and sellers are free to leverage these materials and gain valuable hands-on experience 
with Cisco's Full Stack Observability solutions.

## Workshop Delivery Approach

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of 
through manual processes. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure 
specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you 
provision the same environment every time.  

Immutable infrastructure is an approach to managing services and deployments of IT resources (applications 
and infrastructure) where components are replaced rather than changed. This capability is deemed absolutely 
critical to support reproducibility and scale.  

This workshop leverages these two approaches by automating the build and deployment of workshop public cloud 
and on-prem resources.

## Get Started

To get started, AppDynamics SEs, partners, or others tasked with delivering the Workshop need to build and 
deploy the necessary cloud and on-prem resources required for each provider:

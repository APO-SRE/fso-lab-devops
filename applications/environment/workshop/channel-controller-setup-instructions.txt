This ZIP file should work on any Linux host that has Java 1.8; (However,) there are 2 files
( setupWorkshop.sh & workshop-setup.yaml ) that have a hardcoded path in them which is:

/home/ec2-user/environment/workshop/

So, you only need to do the following:

 * create the directory and/or user for: /home/ec2-user/environment/workshop/'
 * copy the zip file there and unzip it
 * chmod all the '.sh' files to executable
 * set the lab user variable - export appd_workshop_user=EDB12
 * run the 'setupWorkshop.sh'

Let me know if you have any questions!
